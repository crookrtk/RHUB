## Introduction

**Relentom** was made for the ease of VR Access on ROBLOX, and VR capabilities in all games as the VR API on ROBLOX isn't the best.


`It is reccomended to have a decent VR-Ready PC, alongside a VR Headset compatible with Relentom Hub.`

## :rocket: Auto Execution

If you place **Relentoms** loader in your Auto Execution folder, it will load as normal, don't be alarmed by your game lagging for a few seconds after loading in.

### :pushpin: Latest Free Release

I plan to make Relentom avaliable to all, so later on this area will have the skimmed-down free version of Relentom Hub.

## :sparkling_heart: Support

- :wavy_dash: ScriptWare (Still being tested with.)
- :white_check_mark: Synapse X (Fully functional and loads all scripts normally.)
- :white_check_mark: Krnl (Scripts will be highly unstable with KRNL, beware!)
